    <h3><strong>I. Floors: </strong></h3>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look at the floor in each room.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you walk through a room, do you have to walk around furniture?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Ask someone to move the furniture so your path is clear.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you have throw rugs on the floor?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Remove the rugs or use double-sided tape or a non-slip backing so the rugs won't slip.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are there papers, books, towels, shoes, magazines, boxes, blankets, or other objects on the floor?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Pick up things that are on the floor. Always keep objects off the floor.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you have to walk over or around wires or cords (like lamp, telephone, or extension cords)?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Coil or tape cords and wires next to the wall so you can't trip over them. If needed, have an electrician put in another outlet.</span></p>
    <h3><strong>II. Stairs and Steps: </strong></h3>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look at the stairs you use both inside and outside your home.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are there papers, shoes, boxes, or other objects on the stairs?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Pick up things on the stairs. Always keep objects off stairs.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are some steps broken or uneven?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Fix loose or uneven steps.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you missing a light over the stairway?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Have an electrician put in an overhead light at the top and bottom of the stairs.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you have only one light switch for your stairs (only at the top or at the bottom of the stairs)?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Have an electrician put in a light switch at the top and bottom of the stairs. You can get light switches that glow.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Has the stairway light bulb burned out?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Have a friend or family member change the light bulb.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is the carpet on the steps loose or torn?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Make sure the carpet is firmly attached to every step, or remove the carpet and attach non-slip rubber treads to the stairs.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are the handrails loose or broken? Is there a handrail on only one side of the stairs?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Fix loose handrails or put in new ones. Make sure handrails are on both sides of the stairs and are as long as the stairs.</span></p>
    <h3><strong>III. Kitchen: </strong></h3>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look at your kitchen and eating area.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are the things you use often on high shelves?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Move items in your cabinets. Keep things you use often on the lower shelves (about waist level).</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is your step stool unsteady?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- If you must use a step stool, get one with a bar to hold on to. Never use a chair as a step stool.</span></p>
    <h3><strong>IV. Bathrooms: </strong></h3>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look at all your bathrooms.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is the tub or shower floor slippery?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Put a non-slip rubber mat or self stick strips on the floor of the tub or shower.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you need some support when you get in and out of the tub or up from the toiler?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Have grab bars put in next to and inside the tub and next to the toilet.</span></p>
    <h3><strong>V. Bedrooms: </strong></h3>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look at all your bedrooms.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is the light near the bed hard to reach?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Place a lamp close to the bed where it's easy to reach.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is the path from your bed to the bathroom dark?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Put in a night-light so you can see where you're walking. Some night-lights go on by themselves after dark.</span></p>
    <h3><strong>VI. Other Things you can do to Prevent Fall</strong></h3>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Do exercises that improve your balance and make your legs stronger. Exercise also helps you feel better and more confident.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Have your doctor or pharmacist look at all the medications you take, even over-the-counter medicines. Some medicines can make you sleepy or dizzy.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Have your eyes checked by an eye doctor at least once a year and update your glasses.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Get up slowly after you sit or lie down.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Wear shoes both inside and outside the house. Avoid going barefoot or wearing slippers.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Improve the lighting in your home. Put in brighter light bulbs. Fluorescent bulbs are bright and cost less to use.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- It's safest to have uniform lighting in a room. Add lighting to dark areas. Hang lightweight curtains or shades to reduce glare.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Paint a contrasting color on the top edge of all steps so you can see the stairs better. For example, use a light color paint on dark wood.</span></p>
    <h3><strong>VII.&nbsp;Other Safety Tips</strong></h3>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Keep emergency numbers in large print near each phone.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Put a phone near the floor in case you fall and can't get up.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Think about wearing an alarm device that will bring help in case you fall and can't get up.</span></p>
