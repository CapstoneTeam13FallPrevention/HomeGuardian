We are not liable for any harm that comes to the user while using this app. This app was designed to help reduce the risk to potential falls in the home.

    <h3><strong>Accuracy</strong></h3>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 500;">Home Guardian has worked hard to ensure the accuracy of the device through its services through this mobile application. Although we aim to reduce the risk of potential falls in your home, our services do not guarantee that the risk of falling in your home will be completely eliminated. Home guardian seeks to decrease your risk of falling based on the information you provide. This app was created to make your home safer without the need of a therapist coming to you home. However, whether the results are for the better depends on the quality of photos you provide as well as if you take the advice given to you. </span></p>
